Introduction:
In today's world, a lot of people buy things online. It's a big part of how we shop. Knowing what people like to buy, when they buy the most, and how much things usually cost online is important for both businesses and people who make the rules (policymakers). This study wants to dig into these things to understand more about how people act when they shop online.

Imagine online shopping as a big, always-changing place. We want to figure out what people prefer, when they shop the most, and how much they usually spend. This isn't just about buying and selling; it's about understanding why people choose certain things online. This information is useful for businesses to make better plans and for policymakers to make fair rules.

To do this, we collected a bunch of information from different places. We looked at what people buy on popular online shops, asked them questions in surveys, and checked reports about the industry. This mix of data helps us get a good look at how people are shopping online.

Our way of figuring things out is a bit like putting together a puzzle. We look closely at how people act online, like what kinds of things they buy, how they pay, and who they are. We also check when people shop the most by looking at the patterns over time. And when it comes to figuring out how much things usually cost, we use math to look at the prices of different stuff and find the average, middle, and range.

In short, this study wants to shine a light on the interesting parts of how people shop online. By looking closely at what people like, when they shop the most, and how much they spend, we hope to help businesses and policymakers understand this digital world better. It's like exploring a new land to learn its secrets and make better choices for the future. 

Datasets:
To analyze online shopping preferences, peak activity, and price ranges, I have gathered data from diverse sources. These datasets include user transactions from prominent e-commerce platforms, customer surveys, and industry reports. The comprehensive nature of these datasets allows for a nuanced examination of the factors influencing online shopping trends.

Methodology:
My research employs a multi-faceted methodology to explore the common online shopping preferences among individuals. To identify trends, we conduct a thorough analysis of user behavior, considering factors such as product categories, payment methods, and user demographics. The peak activity months are determined through time-series analysis of transaction volumes, highlighting the periods of heightened online shopping.

Furthermore, to ascertain the typical price range for items purchased online, I will perform statistical analyses on product pricing across various categories. This involves assessing the distribution of prices and identifying the average, median, and range. The methodology adopted ensures a comprehensive understanding of the nuances within the online shopping landscape, providing valuable insights for businesses and policymakers.
