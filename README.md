Introduction:
Online shopping has become an integral part of consumers' lives. Understanding the common preferences, peak activity months, and average price ranges in online shopping is crucial for businesses and policymakers alike. This study aims to delve into these aspects to gain insights into the dynamic landscape of online consumer behavior. 

Datasets:
To analyze online shopping preferences, peak activity, and price ranges, I have gathered data from diverse sources. These datasets include user transactions from prominent e-commerce platforms, customer surveys, and industry reports. The comprehensive nature of these datasets allows for a nuanced examination of the factors influencing online shopping trends.

Methodology:
My research employs a multi-faceted methodology to explore the common online shopping preferences among individuals. To identify trends, we conduct a thorough analysis of user behavior, considering factors such as product categories, payment methods, and user demographics. The peak activity months are determined through time-series analysis of transaction volumes, highlighting the periods of heightened online shopping.

Furthermore, to ascertain the typical price range for items purchased online, I will perform statistical analyses on product pricing across various categories. This involves assessing the distribution of prices and identifying the average, median, and range. The methodology adopted ensures a comprehensive understanding of the nuances within the online shopping landscape, providing valuable insights for businesses and policymakers.
